Creating a structured repository involves a few fundamental Git and terminal commands. To add a new folder with code, you generally follow a "Create, Stage, Commit" workflow.

### 1. Create the Folder and File

In most operating systems, Git does not track empty folders. You must place a file inside the folder for Git to recognize it.

* **Open your terminal** and navigate to your local repository.
* **Create a new directory:**
`mkdir my-new-folder`
* **Create a code file inside that folder:**
`touch my-new-folder/app.py`
*(Note: You can use any extension like `.java`, `.js`, or `.cpp` depending on your project.)*

### 2. Add and Commit the Changes

Once your file is created, you need to tell Git to track it.

* **Stage the changes:**
`git add my-new-folder/`
This command stages the entire folder and everything inside it.
* **Commit to your local history:**
`git commit -m "Add new folder with initial code"`

---

### 3. Push to the Remote Repository

If you are working with a hosted platform (like GitHub or GitLab), you need to send your local commits to the server.

* **Push the code:**
`git push origin main`
*(Note: Replace `main` with your specific branch name, like `master` or `develop`, if different.)*

### Summary Table of Commands

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Make Directory** | `mkdir <folder_name>` |
| **Check Status** | `git status` |
| **Stage Folder** | `git add <folder_name>` |
| **Save Changes** | `git commit -m "your message"` |
| **Upload** | `git push origin <branch_name>` |
